## ‚ö†Ô∏è Sus Requests
**Action:** Block

This category targets potentially suspicious requests. It includes:
- Requests for specific file types and directories that are commonly targeted for attacks or are sensitive (e.g., `.aspx`, `.env`, `.git`, `.php`).
- Requests containing specific URI paths that might indicate probing for vulnerabilities or attempting to exploit known weaknesses (e.g., `/wp-json`, `/backup.zip`, `/sftp`).
- Requests with user agents or specific paths that indicate automated or non-browser access patterns commonly associated with malicious activity.

## üóëÔ∏è Sus Browsers
**Action:** Interactive Challenge

This category deals with suspicious or outdated browsers. It includes:
- User agents associated with older versions of browsers (e.g., old versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Android browsers).
- User agents that are often used by headless browsers or automated tools (e.g., `headlesschrome`, `dalvik`).
- User agents with specific patterns indicating non-standard browsing activity or potential for abuse.

For these requests, an interactive challenge (like CAPTCHA) is presented to verify that the requester is a legitimate user and not an automated system.

## üíÄ Dangerous Hosts
**Action:** Block

This category blocks access from IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) known for malicious activities. It includes:
- Specific IP addresses that have been flagged for abusive behavior or security risks.
- ASNs associated with high volumes of spam, attacks, or other unwanted activities (e.g., ASNs for known data centers used by attackers).

These rules help to protect the website by preventing access from sources that are likely to be involved in malicious activities.
